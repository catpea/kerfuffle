Visual Programming Language

## TODO

- [x] Add component loading to Root Window
- [x] Nested Transforms
- [ ] Labels must monitor transform stack from their placement up.

- [ ] Switch from JSON to XML

## Laws
- Parent Components Sets The Scene: the child must ass it's .g to the scene (add its svg group to scene set by parent)
- All Controls Have Ports: a control no matter how large or small can paint ports.
- method naming scheme: add + Window + Component = action Parent Class + Class Of Object
- all Controls have this.anchors where named anchors must be stored
- Externally, you may not interact with object's properties directly, only via methods (creating an api, and taking care of minot config)
- root container always has a node, node always has an origin, origin has a root
